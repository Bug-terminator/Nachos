//	Data structures to represent the Nachos file system.
//
//	A file system is a set of files stored on disk, organized
//	into directories.  Operations on the file system have to
//	do with "naming" -- creating, opening, and deleting files,
//	given a textual file name.  Operations on an individual
//	"open" file (read, write, close) are to be found in the OpenFile
//	class (openfile.h).
//
//	We define two separate implementations of the file system.
//	The "STUB" version just re-defines the Nachos file system
//	operations as operations on the native UNIX file system on the machine
//	running the Nachos simulation.  This is provided in case the
//	multiprogramming and virtual memory assignments (which make use
//	of the file system) are done before the file system assignment.
//
//	The other version is a "real" file system, built on top of
//	a disk simulator.  The disk is simulated using the native UNIX
//	file system (in a file named "DISK").
//
//	In the "real" implementation, there are two key data structures used
//	in the file system.  There is a single "root" directory, listing
//	all of the files in the file system; unlike UNIX, the baseline
//	system does not provide a hierarchical directory structure.
//	In addition, there is a bitmap for allocating
//	disk sectors.  Both the root directory and the bitmap are themselves
//	stored as files in the Nachos file system -- this causes an interesting
//	bootstrap problem when the simulated disk is initialized.
