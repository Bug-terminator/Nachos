Subject: Answer to problems running assignment 5

Some people have been having problems running assignment 5.
Unfortunately, the way the network gets initialized, if things
don't get done in exactly the right order, you can get an error
in sending the first packet to the socket.

I have modified synch.h and synch.cc in code/, and re-compiled
the contents of code/network.  I was then able to run the
test case successfully, at least one out of two times.  See below.
So, be careful out there!
