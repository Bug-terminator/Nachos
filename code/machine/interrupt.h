// interrupt.h 
//	Data structures to emulate low-level interrupt hardware.
//
//	The hardware provides a routine (SetLevel) to enable or disable
//	interrupts.
//
//	In order to emulate the hardware, we need to keep track of all
//	interrupts the hardware devices would cause, and when they
//	are supposed to occur.  
//
//	This module also keeps track of simulated time.  Time advances
//	only when the following occur: 
//		interrupts are re-enabled
//		a user instruction is executed
//		there is nothing in the ready queue
//
//	As a result, unlike real hardware, interrupts (and thus time-slice 
//	context switches) cannot occur anywhere in the code where interrupts
//	are enabled, but rather only at those places in the code where 
//	simulated time advances (so that it becomes time to invoke an
//	interrupt in the hardware simulation).
//
//	NOTE: this means that incorrectly synchronized code may work
//	fine on this hardware simulation (even with randomized time slices),
//	but it wouldn't work on real hardware.  (Just because we can't
//	always detect when your program would fail in real life, does not 
//	mean it's ok to write incorrectly synchronized code!)
//
//  DO NOT CHANGE -- part of the machine emulation
