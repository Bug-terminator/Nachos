// translate.h 
//	Data structures for managing the translation from 
//	virtual page # -> physical page #, used for managing
//	physical memory on behalf of user programs.
//
//	The data structures in this file are "dual-use" - they
//	serve both as a page table entry, and as an entry in
//	a software-managed translation lookaside buffer (TLB).
//	Either way, each entry is of the form:
//	<virtual page #, physical page #>.

// The following class defines an entry in a translation table -- either
// in a page table or a TLB.  Each entry defines a mapping from one 
// virtual page to one physical page.
// In addition, there are some extra bits for access control (valid and 
// read-only) and some bits for usage information (use and dirty).
