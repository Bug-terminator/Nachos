// disk.h 
//	Data structures to emulate a physical disk.  A physical disk
//	can accept (one at a time) requests to read/write a disk sector;
//	when the request is satisfied, the CPU gets an interrupt, and 
//	the next request can be sent to the disk.
//
//	Disk contents are preserved across machine crashes, but if
//	a file system operation (eg, create a file) is in progress when the 
//	system shuts down, the file system may be corrupted.
//
//  DO NOT CHANGE -- part of the machine emulation

// The following class defines a physical disk I/O device.  The disk
// has a single surface, split up into "tracks", and each track split
// up into "sectors" (the same number of sectors on each track, and each
// sector has the same number of bytes of storage).  
//
// Addressing is by sector number -- each sector on the disk is given
// a unique number: track * SectorsPerTrack + offset within a track.
//
// As with other I/O devices, the raw physical disk is an asynchronous device --
// requests to read or write portions of the disk return immediately,
// and an interrupt is invoked later to signal that the operation completed.
//
// The physical disk is in fact simulated via operations on a UNIX file.
//
// To make life a little more realistic, the simulated time for
// each operation reflects a "track buffer" -- RAM to store the contents
// of the current track as the disk head passes by.  The idea is that the
// disk always transfers to the track buffer, in case that data is requested
// later on.  This has the benefit of eliminating the need for 
// "skip-sector" scheduling -- a read request which comes in shortly after 
// the head has passed the beginning of the sector can be satisfied more 
// quickly, because its contents are in the track buffer.  Most 
// disks these days now come with a track buffer.
//
// The track buffer simulation can be disabled by compiling with -DNOTRACKBUF
