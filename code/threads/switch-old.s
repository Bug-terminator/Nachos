/* switch.s 
 *   	Machine dependent context switch routines.  DO NOT MODIFY THESE! 
 *
 *	Context switching is inherently machine dependent, since
 *	the registers to be saved, how to set up an initial
 *	call frame, etc, are all specific to a processor architecture.
 *
 * 	This file currently supports the following architectures:
 *	    DEC MIPS
 *	    SUN SPARC
 *	    HP PA-RISC
 *	    Intel 386
 *
 * We define two routines for each architecture:
 *
 * ThreadRoot(InitialPC, InitialArg, WhenDonePC, StartupPC)
 *	InitialPC  - The program counter of the procedure to run
 *			in this thread.
 *      InitialArg - The single argument to the thread.
 *	WhenDonePC - The routine to call when the thread returns.
 *	StartupPC  - Routine to call when the thread is started.
 *
 *	ThreadRoot is called from the SWITCH() routine to start
 *	a thread for the first time. 
 *
 * SWITCH(oldThread, newThread)
 * 	oldThread  - The current thread that was running, where the
 *		CPU register state is to be saved.
 * 	newThread  - The new thread to be run, where the CPU register
 *		state is to be loaded from.
